Merge pull request #32 from marcbaechinger/master
removed some warnings like obsolete code
refactored the handling of current playback position to make sure the position is not reset to zero when the videoView is paused while being behind the launcher. If paused behind the launcher videoView.getCurrentPosition() returns zero. That's why we have to track the position ourself to not loose it while the Now Playing card is shown and the user can press the play/pause button on the remote control which triggers our MediaController.Callback.
